Welcome to the world of Tetris but BloodBorne styled but do not worry, it won't be as hard or it might be. 

Arrow Key Up = This key will rotate your tetris block
Arrow Key Down = This will make the tetris block fall faster
Arrow Key Left = This will make the tetris move to the left
Arrow Key Right = this will make the tetris move to the right

The game will be two players. First player will go first. then the second player. You can only move the pieces in specific ways; your game is over if your pieces reach the top of the screen; and you can only remove pieces from the screen by filling all the blank space in a line which also increases your score. The player with the top score will be the winner out of two players. If players have the same score, the game ends in a tie.# Tetris
